# Ant-CHCs-Desiccation
# Update for co-authors, "Most Important CHCs"

Individual comparison of CHCs vs. LT50, using multiple methods (Spearman correlations, Random Forest, PLSR).

- [ ]  PLSR and where it was left off
    - PLSR model 1 and 2 comparisons (Tables)
    - StackedBarPlot showing how di-methylâ€™s are not biologically significantly different
- [ ]  Return to raw masses
    - Bar graph of CHC class masses
- [ ]  PLSR with all CHCs individually
    - Forest plot with CHC classes colored
    - LWS threshold idea from the literature (screenshots)
- [ ]  Use of random forest selection for figuring out which CHCs we should look at
    - Forest plot
    - Screenshots of MostImportantCHCs excel sheet
- [ ]  Conclusions
    - SumCHC vs. Avg to show that body mass does not mean more CHCs
    - Ants with profile acclimation to dry climate perform the worst in assay
    - MOST POSITIVE RESULT: Many other studies use a proxy of survival instead of measuring actual survival. Our Argies may be unique, but this does suggest that we should heed with caution when implying that certain CHC properties would lead to improved survival in the face of desiccation.

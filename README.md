# Ant-CHCs-Desiccation
Repository for the analysis of which CHCs or CHC classes influence the survival of Argentine ants under experimentally induced desiccation. At the origin of this repository, the code was designed to perform the following functions:

  - Visualization of collinearity between cuticular hydrocarbon abundances, and other covariates, using GGpairs
  - Partial least squares regressions (PLSR) to identify which covariates best explain survival (measured in mean LT50 per group replicate)
  - Visualizations of PLSR results, primarily using base plots and ggscatter
  - Stacked bar graph of different CHC classes per colony CHC profile

**Examples of results/graphs from this PLSR branch:**

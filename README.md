# Ant-CHCs-Desiccation
# Random forest branch

Individual comparison of CHCs vs. LT50, using multiple methods (Spearman correlations, Random Forest, PLSR).
Also, this branch marks the beginning of using "CHC mass per body mass" instead of CHC mass and body mass as separate covariates or correlates in a model.
